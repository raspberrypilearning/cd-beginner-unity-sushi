## Make the world's ground

Now you're going to create a ground plane for MazeRobo to move about on!

+ Start by adding a **Quad** object to be the ground (**GameObject > 3D Object > Quad**). Change the name of this object from `Quad` to `Ground` in the Inspector.
 
+ In the Inspector for this new object under **Transform**, set the **X Rotation** to `90`, and for **Scale**, enter these values:
```
  X = 40.96
  Y = 40.96
  Z = 1
```

Gah! MazeRobo’s stuck halfway into the ground! Let's move her up by one meter.

+ Select MazeRobo and, in the Inspector under **Transform**, set the following **Position** coordinates: 
```
  X = 0
  Y = 1
  Z = 0
```

Now you’ll add a wall to start your maze!

+ Create a Cube (**GameObject > 3D Object > Cube**) and set its **Transform Position** to:
```
  X = -2
  Y = 1.5
  Z = 0 
```
+ Set the Y **Scale** to `3` and rename the object to `Wall`.
 
+ Now make a new material for `Wall` (**Assets > Create > Materials**), rename it `WallBlue`, and change its albedo to give it a (surprise!) blue colour.

+ Assign the `WallBlue` material to `Wall` using the **MeshRender > Materials** section of the Inspector (you can also drag the material straight onto the object).

Later on, you’ll turn this wall into a maze for MazeRobo to explore!
