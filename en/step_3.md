## Setting the Stage

Before you get started making your game, You need to do a little setup.

+ Start Unity and choose **New** to create a new project

+ When asked for a name for the project, call it "Beginner Unity Sushi" so it'll be easy to find later!

+ Click "Create Project" and wait for your project to appear on screen!

+ In the top-right corner of the Unity window you'll see a menu called "Layout". Click on it and pick "Default".

+ Look at the panel named **Assets**. You should see a folder there called "Scenes".

If there is no folder named "Scenes", you can create it.

+ Go to the menu bar (at the top of the screen if you're on a Mac, or at the top of the Unity window on a PC) and choose the "Assets" menu near the left.

+ Select **Create > Folder**, which means pick the "Create" option and then the "Folder" option in the menu that opens underneath.

+ You'll be asked for a name for your new folder. Call it `Scenes`.

The next thing you need is a scene. In fact, you already have this because the game started with one. You just need to save it.

+ Go to the top menu and choose **File > Save Scene as...**. You'll need to give the scene a name and choose a location to save it in. Call it `MazeRoboBegins` and save it in the "Scenes" folder (it's inside the "Assets" folder).

+ Remember to save regularly as you go along, so that you don't accidentally lose all your hard work!

+ To save, click **File > Save Scenes**, or press the `Ctrl` (`Cmd` on a Mac!) and `S` keys together.
