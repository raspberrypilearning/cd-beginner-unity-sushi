## Set the stage

Before you can get started making your game, you need to do a little setup.

+ Start Unity and choose **New** to create a new project.

+ When asked for a name for the project, call it "Beginner Unity Sushi" so it'll be easy to find later!

+ Click **Create Project** and wait for your project to appear on screen!

+ In the top right-hand corner of the Unity window, you'll see a menu called **Layout**. Click on it and pick **Default**.

+ Look at the panel named **Assets**. You should see a folder there called **`Scenes`**.

If there is no folder named `Scenes`, you can create it.

+ Go to the menu bar (on a Mac it's at the top of the screen, on a Windows PC it's at the top of the Unity window) and choose the **Assets** menu toward the left.

+ Select **Create > Folder**, which means pick the **Create** option and then the **Folder** option in the menu that opens below.

+ You'll be asked for a name for your new folder. Call it `Scenes`.

The next thing you need is a scene. It turns our you already have one, because the Unity project started with one, so you just need to save it.

+ Go to the top menu and choose **File > Save Scene as...**. You'll need to give the scene a name and choose a location to save it in. Call it `MazeRoboBegins` and save it in the `Scenes` folder that's inside the `Assets` folder.

+ Remember to save regularly as you go along, so that you don't accidentally lose all your hard work!

+ To save, click **File > Save Scenes**, or press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (<kbd>cmd</kbd> on a Mac!) and <kbd>s</kbd> keys together.
